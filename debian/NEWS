linbpq (6.0.24.22-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  This is quite a big update, with config moving from /opt/oarc/bpq/bpq32.cfg to
  /etc/bpq32.cfg. The system shall do this automatically for you, however
  computers and their programmers are not perfect.

  I strongly recommend at this point backing up your entire
  /opt/oarc/bpq/ directory (cp -r /opt/oarc/bpq/ ~/bpq-backup/) before
  proceeding with the upgrade
